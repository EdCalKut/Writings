As a Gorenstein surface singularity are of DuVal type we see that the minimal resolution can only admit maps to $\mb{F}_0$, $\mb{F}_1$ or $\mb{F}_2$. We now ask what possible torus actions can there be on these Hirzebruch surfaces such that we will only have DuVal singularities. For convenience we write the fan of $\mb{F}_n$ having rays generated by $(1,0)$, $(0,1)$, $(-1, n)$, $(0,-1)$. We can then write a subtorus as a vector $v \in N$.


We make the observation, to save time, that we have classified all log del Pezzo surfaces which do only admit maps to $\mb{F}_0$ or $\mb{F}_1$ ~\ref{Theroem on curves}. This results in only one surface.


For the case of $\mb{F}_2$ either our torus action coincides with a ray of the fan or it does not. There are only four cases where it coincides. However via symmetry we only need to consider the rays $(0,1)$ and $(1,0)$. In the first case your surface has two parabolic lines and hence admits a well defined map to $\mb{P}^1$. As this a morphism we see that the our torus invariant fibers are $0$ curves. The only ways to blow up a zero curve to get values greater than $-2$ are:
\begin{itemize}
\item $-2$, $-1$, $-2$
\item $-1$, $-2$, \dots , $-2$, $-1$
\item $-1$, $-1$
\item $0$
\end{itemize}
We note that with the exception of the second case nothing there are finitely many options. It is clear that in the second case a chain of $k$ $-2$ curves can only arise on a fiber by blowing up parbolic lines a total of $k+1$ times. However earlier on we showed that there could only be a total of $4$ blowups on the parabolic line hence this is bounded.  


The case of the vector $v = (1,0)$ corresponds to the case of one parabolic line and this case is dealt with in the next paragraphs.


Dealing with the case where the vector $v$ does not correspond to a ray of the fan. To do a non toric blowup we need to do a  sequence of blowups that will produce a line of torus invariant points. We note that if we do this twice then there will be a well defined map to $\mb{P}^1$ with the two parabolic lines being sections. This means that there would be a map to a Hirzerbuch surface such that one of these lines is being sent to the negative section and the other to the positive. As both of these would be fixed by the torus action these have been classified in the previous paragraphs.


In the case we have one parabolic line, this line has to arise as a weighted blowup of a point $P$ which is the intersection of a fiber $F$ and a section $A$. This is because any other torus fixed point would lie on the $-2$ curve, which we would then have to blow up, which would contradict DuVal singularities. Without loss of generality we can assume that our torus fixed point corresponds to cone $(1,0)$, $(0, -1)$. This gives us an affine chart $\mb{A}^2_{x, \, y}$ with the coordinates corresponding to the rays $(1,0)$, $(0, -1)$. The only possible weights are then $(1,1)$, $(2,1)$, $(1,2)$, $(1,3)$ and $(1,-4)$. So the only possible coordinates for $v$ are $(1, -1)$, $(2, -1)$, $(1, -2)$, $(1, -3)$ and $(1,-4)$. We note that if $v = (1,-2)$ is a torus action which also corresponds with a ray, this has a fiber with self intersection $2$. Given a fibration, the fact we can only blow up one side of each fiber means the only possible fibers are of the form 

\begin{itemize}
\item $-1$, $-2$, \dots $-2$ , $n-1$
\item $-2$, $-2$, \dots $-2$, $n-k$
\item $-2$, $-2$, \dots $-2$, $-1$, $-2$

\end{itemize}

The fibres in the other case go have values ranging from $1$ (the $(1,1)$ blowup) to $3$ (the $(2,1)$ weighted blowup). Our analysis can be simplified by noting that after a suitable number of contractions we reach a smooth toric variety which is the minimal resolution of a Gorenstein del Pezzo surface. This results in a massive amount of surfaces, many of which are isomorphic.
However every single one is the minimal resolution of a log del Pezzo surface.

\end{ex}

\begin{rem}
The fact that every surface we produce is the minimal resolution of a log del Pezzo surface in the case that index equals one is unique to this case. This follows from index one singularities having the discrepancy of every curve being equal to zero. In index two it is easy to produce toric surfaces which are not the minimal resolution of a log del Pezzo surface.
\end{rem}


With the above disclaimer we carry on. We know that our standard admit a canonical map to a Hirzebruch surface, so we instead work backwards, take a Hirzebruch surface, look at a subtorus action on it and consider all the ways we can make a basic surface out of it.
\\
From here on out our fan for a Hirzebruch surface $\mathbb{F}_n$ will be $(0,1), \, (1,0), \, (0,-1), \, (-1, n)$. There are 4 possible ways the diagram of the Weil divisors on a Hirzebruch surface with a given $\mathbb{C}^*$ action can look
\begin{enumerate}[label =\Alph*]
\item - Two parabolic lines, this corresponds with the subtorus $(0, \pm 1)$.
\item - One parabolic line, this corresponds to the subtorus $(\pm 1, 0)$.
\item - Two elliptic points, connected by a line, this corresponds the sublattice generated by a point lieing in between $(-1,0)$ and $(-1, n)$.
\item - Two elliptic points, not connected by a line, this corresponds to any other point.
\end{enumerate} 


In the above pictures we have the $n$ curve on the top and the $(-n)$ curve on the bottom, with the two vertical lines being the 0 fibers. The blue lines are parabolic lines, and the red points represent elliptic points.
\\
\\
If $X$ is a log del Pezzo with $Y$ its minimal resolution. The number of Elliptic points can only decrease in the cascade , hence we see that it would map down to one of B, C, D. Next note that if we consider case C or D there is no way to make it non toric without resolving one of the elliptic points. Because of this we have the following theorem 
\\
\begin{thm}
Let $X$ be a complexity one log del Pezzo, $Y$ its minimal resolution. Then if $Y$ has two elliptic points, then $X$ is toric.
\end{thm}
We now split things into a case by case analysis. In case A, we have 0 fibers so we just substitute them with the all possible choices of fibers in\autoref{T:ZDQ}, using \cite{IMT} we know that we can only substitute in at most 4 fibers. Hence this case is finished. Note that actually the 4 fibers comes out in the calculations in this case, although that does not prove the general log del Pezzo case.
\\
\\
 For case B, if we resolve the elliptic point on $Y$ in the process of our cascade then it admits a canoncial $\mathbb{P}^1$ fibration, hence we can factor it through case A. Hence we only care about ones that preserve the elliptic point. From the fan we know that it requires $n$ blowups of $\mathbb{F}_n$ to resolve the elliptic point, in these cases the elliptic point lies on the intersection of a $(-1)$ curve and a curve $C$ with $C^2 > 0$. We also see that the zero curve intersecting the elliptic point has to be taken to one of the cases \autoref{T:ZDQ} , we deal with the three cases, nothing happens at the elliptic point, it becomes an $A_n$ singularity and finally the $[ -2, -1, -2]$. If $n \neq 1,2$ then we cannot have an $A_n$ singularity, as we would have a $(-1)$ curve next to a curve with positive self intersection, i.e  the top line, so we would have to keep on blowing up till it has negative self intersection, but this would resolve the elliptic point. Also note if $n=0$ case B does not occur, it would take zero blowups to resolve the elliptic singularity, i.e we just have two parabolic lines, so it is just case A. We deal with $n=1, \, 2$ separately. In the case of nothing happening at the elliptic point. We need to blow up two point on the parabolic curve to get a non toric surface. After this we have two $(-1)$ intersecting $(-2)$ curves, we know by \autoref{T:ZDQ} there is nothing more we can do at those points, so we are left with only being able to blow up the intersection of a $(-1)$ curve with a positive curve. We know we cannot blow up a third point on the parabolic line or it will stop being a klt singularity.  Moving on to the $[-2, -1, -2]$ case, we have all the same possibilities as before, however it may take slightly less blowups than before we reach an acceptable configuration as we have our elliptic point lieing on a $(-2)$ curve. This leaves with only two non toric options from a given Hirzebruch surface.
\\
\\
In the case of $n=1$ we cannot blowup the elliptic point, the only other difference is not being able to use the klt argument, however the $(-1)$ curve being next to the 0 curve guarantees that it still cannot be less than $(-2)$, and if we modify the $(-1)$ curve in any other way it would arise from a different configuration and hence has already been classified. In the case $n = 2$ it also falls under the previous classifaction as we are only allowed one blowup and in this case the two $(-1)$ curves intersect.
\\
\\
In case C we see there is a symmetry between the two elliptic points, so it does not matter which we resolve. When we resolve it we will have $(-1)$ curve adjacent to at most two sets of negative curves. To make a non toric example, we need to blow up one of the lines connecting the parabolic line to the elliptic point. This curve has self intersection greater than 0, using the same argument as before, we can only blow up one point on the parabolic line. As our curve has positive self intersection we know, that we have to have, by the previous argument again, the following set of curves connecting to our parabolic line $[-2, \, -1, \,  -2, \dots -2 ]$. In particular the number of $-2$ curves is greater than two. Using [Ishii, Brieskhorn] classification of singularities, we see that to be klt, you have to have at most 3 negative meeting in a point and one of those has to be just $-2$ curve. Because of this the possible points generating the torus action, up to symmetry, are 
\\
\begin{itemize}
\item $(n, -1)$ or $(1, -n)$, here this is a $\mathbb{P}(1, n)$ blowup. One component is smooth.
\item $(2n - 1, -2)$ or $(2, -2n+1)$ this weighted blowup gives a $\frac{1}{2}(1,1)$ singularity in one chart, this is the singularity whose resolution is a just a $(-2)$ curve. 
\end{itemize}
Note that different values of $n$ give different singularities in the other chart. In the first case, they are clearly just $A_n$ singularities. In the second case, you just get $[-3, \, -2, \dots -2]$, here the chain has $n-1$ of the $(-2)$ curves. We also need both case of the these torus actions as the vary which side the singularities appear. Of course the Brieskhorn classification is much more comprehensive than this, and once the code is written I will start a more comprehensive check as to which or these give klt log del Pezzos. 
\\
\\
In case D, it proceeds almost exactly the same as case C. However you do not have the pleasantness of the symmetry. However it is still straight forward what will happen, the elliptic point next to $0$ curve and the $n$ curve will have the same possible choices of torus actions as in Case C. For the one on the intersection on the $(-n)$ curve and the 0 curve, 2 of the expected 4 options will not occur due to the presence of the $(-n)$ curve. The Brieskhorn classification in this situation gives us $n \leq 5$.
