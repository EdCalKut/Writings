Miles notes:

Suggestions to improve the prose of classification of small log discrepancy

You should refer throughout to singularities $\frac1r(1,b)$
with $[a_1,\dots,a_n] = r/b$, rather than the awkward
mouthful "singularities $S$ with minimal resolution
$a_1,..a_n$ or $-a_1,..-a_n$ etc."

[The notation goes back to Hirzebruch, and everyone knows
them.]

You should refer throughout to the minimal discrepancy
condition $a_1,a_n\ge3$ of Proposition~\ref{earlier Prop!3.2}


p.13, break Theorem 6.1 into section.

The first sentence would go better before Theorem 6.1:

Given $[a_1,\dots,a_n] = r/b$ satisfying the minimal
discrepancy condition $a_1,a_n\ge3$ of
Proposition~\ref{earlier Prop!3.2}, the finitely many basic
log del Pezzo surfaces $X_i$ with singularity $\frac1r(1,b)$
were classified in the course of the proof of
Theorem~\ref{th!previous Thm 4.7}. Recall that a
neighbourhood of the $j$th curve $E_i$ maps isomorphically
to a neighbourhood of the negative section of the scroll
$\FF_{a_i}$ for some $j=1,\dots,n$.

[I don't know what "basic" means -- you probably mean the
head of a cascade, with no $-1$-curves in the complement of
the orbifold points. It would be worth making the
classification you refer to as a formal Theorem.]

Theorem 6.1 Let $X_i$ be as above.

Then the blowup at $m$ general points of $X_i$ is again a
log del Pezzo surfaces for

m <= a_j+3-n  if j <> 1,n
<= a_j+4-n




p.20 last two Remark add \rm
Your prose is awkward.

Remark 1. \rm For $k_1,k_2\gg a$, large parts of this
cascade cannot exist.

Remark 2. \rm There are definitely cases when $X_{a_i}$ does
not exist. For ex ... [-3,-8,...-3]. There exists a surface
$X$ whose resolution has a morphism to $\FF_8$. On the other
hand, there is no surface whose resolution maps to $\FF_3$.


p.21, last section.

title -> Outside small discrepancy [omit "of the"]

The big figure: -1 -> $-1$ and -3 -> $-3$ throughout.
after figure: -K_X^2 = 3/5 -> (-K_X)^2 = 3/5
cox rings -> Cox rings
it lies as a complete intersection
  -> it is the codimension two complete intersection
The displayed equations would fit on one line
 (first expr.) = (second expr.) = 0.
 We note that there are also surfaces with the same numerics
 that admit a toric degeneration.

 I think your "hence any degeneration would have to be
 equivariant" is unconvincing. If it is correct and worth
 saying, it might be worth proclaiming it as a Proposition.
